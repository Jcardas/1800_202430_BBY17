# Farmer's Marketplace

## 1. Project Description

We are developing an online marketplace for farmers to sell excess seeds and crops, and community members to buy fresh produce straight from the farm.

Anyone can buy, but only verified farmers can post. Buyers can search for products by name, and filter/sort by price or review. They can contact sellers via our built-in messenger. Sellers can post and edit/delete their posts.
